Tutorials
=========

In addition to the examples, we propose a list of tutorials that can be tested
online without having to install Akantu locally.

The tutorials are available on `Renku IO
<https://renkulab.io/projects/guillaume.anciaux/akantu-tutorials/sessions/new?autostart=1>`_

The code of the tutorials can be found on GitLab in `akantu/tutorials <https://gitlab.com/akantu/tutorials>`_

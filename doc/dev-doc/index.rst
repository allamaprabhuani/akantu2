Akantu: a FEM library
=====================

[![status](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/3abf3c7945cc9a016a946ce9e02e357f/status.svg)](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/3abf3c7945cc9a016a946ce9e02e357f) [![status](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-LGPLv3-green)](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl-3.0.en.html)

**Akantu** means a little element in *Kinyarwanda*, a Bantu language. From now
on it is also an opensource object-oriented *Finite-Element* library which has
the ambition to be generic and efficient. **Akantu** is developed within the
*[LSMS](https://lsms.epfl.ch) (Computational Solid Mechanics Laboratory)*, where
research is conducted at the interface of mechanics, material science, and
scientific computing. The open-source philosophy is important for any scientific
software project evolution. The collaboration permitted by shared codes enforces
sanity when users (and not only developers) can criticize the implementation
details. Akantu was born with the vision to associate genericity, robustness and
efficiency while benefiting the open-source visibility.

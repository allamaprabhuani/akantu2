\section{Creating and loading a mesh\label{sect:common:mesh}}

\akantu supports meshes generated with Gmsh~\cite{gmsh}, a free
software available at \url{http://geuz.org/gmsh/} where a detailed 
documentation can be found. Consequently this manual will not provide
Gmsh usage directions. Gmsh outputs meshes in \textit{.msh} format, that can be read
by \akantu. In order to import a mesh, it is necessary to create
a \code{Mesh} object through the following function calls:
\begin{cpp}
  UInt spatial_dimension = 2;
  Mesh mesh(spatial_dimension);
\end{cpp}
The only parameter that has to be specified by the user is the spatial
dimension of the problem. Now it is possible to read a \textit{.msh} file with
a \textit{MeshIOMSH} object that takes care of loading a mesh to memory. 
This step is carried out by:
\begin{cpp}
  MeshIOMSH mesh_io;
  mesh_io.read("square.msh", mesh);
\end{cpp}
where the \textit{MeshIOMSH} object is first created before being 
used to read the \text{.msh} file. The mesh file name as well as the \textit{Mesh}
object must be specified by the user. 

The \textit{MeshIOMSH} object can also write mesh files. This
feature is useful to save a mesh which have been modified during a
simulation. The \code{write} method takes care of it:
\begin{cpp}
  mesh_io.write("square_modified.msh", mesh);
\end{cpp}
which works exactly like the \textit{read} method.

\akantu supports also meshes generated by
DIANA (\url{http://tnodiana.com}), but only in reading mode. An similar
procedure applies where the only
difference is that the \code{MeshIODiana} object should be used
instead of the \code{MeshIOMSH} one. Additional mesh readers can be
introduced in \akantu by coding new \code{MeshIO} objects.

\subsection{Using \textit{Vectors}}

Data in \akantu can be stored in data containers implemented by
the \code{Vector} object. In its most basic usage the \code{Vector} class
implemented in \akantu is similar to the \code{vector} class of
the Standard Template Library (STL) for C++. A simple \code{Vector}
containing a sequence of \texttt{nb\_element} values can be generated with:
\begin{cpp}
  Vector<type> example_vector(nb_element);
\end{cpp}
where \texttt{type} usually is \texttt{Real}, \texttt{UInt} or
\texttt{bool}. Each value is associated to an index, so that data can be
accessed by typing

\begin{cpp}
  type & val = example\_vector(index)
\end{cpp}

\code{Vectors} can also contain a
sequence of values for each index. In that case the number of components 
of each sequence is needed at the \code{Vector} creation. 
For example if we want to create a \code{Vector} to store
the coordinates (sequences of three values) of ten nodes, the appropriate 
code is the following:
\begin{cpp}
  UInt nb_nodes = 10;
  UInt spatial_dimension = 3;

  Vector<Real> position(nb_nodes, spatial_dimension);
\end{cpp}
In this case the $x$ position of node number 8 will be given by
\texttt{position(7, 0)} (in C++ numbering is starting from 0 and not
1). If the number of components for the sequences is not specified, a
default value of 1 is used.

In general a mesh consists of several kinds of elements. Consequently the 
amount of data to be stored can differ for each element type. The straigthforward 
example is the connectivity array, namely the sequences of nodes belonging to
each element. In order to easily manage this kind of data, a
particular data structure called \code{ByElementTypeVector} is available. 
It is just a group of \code{Vectors}, each associated to an element
type. The following code creates a \code{ByElementTypeVector}
object:
\begin{cpp}
  ByElementTypeVector<UInt> connectivity;
\end{cpp}
where \texttt{UInt} can be substituted by any other type. 
Before being able to use \texttt{connectivity} it is
necessary to initialize it, that is allocating the appropriate memory
according to the number of elements in the mesh. This operation can be
automatically carried out

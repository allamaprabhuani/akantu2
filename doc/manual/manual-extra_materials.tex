\subsubsection{Neo-Hookean}\index{Material!Neohookean}

The Neo-Hookean constitutive law is a hyperelastic material formulation, which
results from an extension of the linear elastic relationship (Hooke's Law) for
large deformation. Thus, the model predicts nonlinear stress-strain behavior for
bodies undergoing large deformations.

    \caption{Neo-hookean Stress-strain curve.}
    \label{fig:smm:cl:neo_hookean}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:smm:cl:neo_hookean}, the behavior is initially
linear and the mechanical behavior is very close to the corresponding linear
elastic material. This constitutive relationship, which accounts for compressibility,
 is a modified version of the one proposed by Ronald Rivlin \cite{Belytschko:2000}.

The strain energy stored in the material is given by:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:smm:constitutive:neohookean_potential}
  \Psi(\mat{C}) = \frac{1}{2}\lambda_0\left(\ln J\right)^2-\mu_0\ln J+\frac{1}{2}
\mu_0\left(\text{trace}(\mat{C})-3\right)
\end{equation}
\noindent where $\lambda_0$ and $\mu_0$ are, respectively, the Lam\'e's first parameter
and the shear modulus at the initial configuration. $J$ is the jacobian of the deformation
gradient ($\mat{F}=\nabla_{\!\!\vec{X}}\vec{x}$): $J=\text{det}(\mat{F})$. Finally $\mat{C}$ is the right Cauchy-Green
deformation tensor.

Since this kind of materials is used for problem involving large deformations, a finite
deformation framework should be used. Therefore, the Cauchy stress ($\mat{\sigma}$) should
be computed through the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor $\mat{S}$:

\begin{equation}
  \mat{\sigma } = \frac{1}{J}\mat{F}\mat{S}\mat{F}^T
\end{equation}

Finally the second Piola-Kirchhoff stress tensor is given by:

\begin{equation}
  \mat{S}  = 2\frac{\partial\Psi}{\partial\mat{C}} = \lambda_0\ln J 
\mat{C}^{-1}+\mu_0\left(\mat{I}-\mat{C}^{-1}\right)
\end{equation}

The parameters to indicate in the material file are the same
as those for the elastic case: \code{E} (Young's modulus), \code{nu} (Poisson's
ratio).

\subsubsection{Visco-elastic (IMPLEMENTATION TO VERIFY!!)}

% Standard Solid rheological model, see [] J.C. Simo, T.J.R. Hughes,
% "Computational Inelasticity", Springer (1998), see Sections 10.2 and 10.3
Visco-elasticity is characterized by time dependent strain behavior. Moreover,
when such a material undergoes a deformation it dissipates some energy. This
dissipation results in a hysteresis loop in the stress-strain curve at every
loading cycle (see Figure~\ref{fig:smm:cl:visco-elastic:hyst}). In principle, it
can be applied to many materials, since all materials exhibit a visco-elastic
behavior if subjected to particular conditions (such as high temperatures).

    \label{fig:smm:cl:visco-elastic}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}
The standard rheological linear solid model (see Sections 10.2 and 10.3
of~\cite{simo92}) has been implemented in \akantu. This model results from the
combination of a spring mounted in parallel with a spring and a dashpot
connected in series, as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:smm:cl:visco-elastic:model}. The advantage of this model is that
it allows to account for creep and stress relaxation. The equation that relates
the stress to the strain is (in 1D):
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\epsilon(t)}{dt} = \left ( E + E_V \right ) ^ {-1} \cdot \left [ \frac{d\sigma(t)}{dt} + \frac{E_V}{\eta}\sigma(t) - \frac{EE_V}{\eta}\epsilon(t) \right ]
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the viscosity. The equilibrium condition is unique and is
attained in the limit, as $t \to \infty $. At this stage, the response is
elastic and depends on the Young's modulus $E$.  The parameters requested in the
material file are the following: \code{rho} (density), \code{E} (Young's
modulus), \code{nu} (Poisson's ratio), \code{Plane\_Stress} (if set to zero
plane strain, otherwise plane stress), \code{eta} (dashpot viscosity) and
\code{Ev} (stiffness of the viscous element).

\subsubsection{Damage}

In the  simplified case of a  linear elastic and brittle  material, isotropic
damage can be represented by a scalar variable $d$, which varies from $0$ to $1$
for  no  damage  to  fully  broken  material  respectively.  The  stress-strain
relationship then becomes:
\begin{equation*}
  \mat{\sigma} = (1-d)\, \mat{C}:\mat{\varepsilon}
\end{equation*}

where  $\mat{\sigma}$,  $\mat{\varepsilon}$ are  the  Cauchy  stress and  strain
tensors, and $\mat{C}$ is the elastic stiffness tensor. This formulation relies
on the definition of a evolution law for the damage variable. In \akantu many
possibilities exists,

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Marigo}
This damage evolution law is energy based as defined by Marigo \cite{marigo81a,
  lemaitre96a}. It is an isotropic damage law.
\begin{align}
  Y &= \frac{1}{2}\mat{\varepsilon}:\mat{C}:\mat{\varepsilon}\\
  F &= Y - Y_d - S d\\
  d &= \left\{
    \begin{array}{l l}
      \mathrm{min}\left(\frac{Y-Y_d}{S},\;1\right) & \mathrm{if}\; F > 0\\
      \mathrm{unchanged} & \mathrm{otherwise}
    \end{array}
  \right.
\end{align}
In this formulation $Y$ is the strain  energy release rate, $Y_d$ is the rupture
criterion and  $S$ is the damage  energy.  The non-local version  of this damage
evolution law is constructed by averaging the energy $Y$.
\item \textbf{Mazars}
This law introduced by Mazars \cite{mazars84a}. It is a behavioral model to
represent damage evolution in concrete. The governing variable in this damage
law is the equivalent strain $\varepsilon_{\st{eq}} =
\sqrt{<\mat{\varepsilon}>_+:<\mat{\varepsilon}>_+}$, with $<.>_+$ the positive
part of the tensor.
The damage the is defined as:
\begin{align}
  D &= \alpha_t^\beta D_t + (1-\alpha_t)^\beta D_c\\
  D_t &= 1 - \frac{\kappa_0 (1- A_t)}{\varepsilon_{\st{eq}}} - A_t \exp^{-B_t(\varepsilon_{\st{eq}}-\kappa_0)}\\
  D_c &= 1 - \frac{\kappa_0 (1- A_c)}{\varepsilon_{\st{eq}}} - A_c
  \exp^{-B_c(\varepsilon_{\st{eq}}-\kappa_0)}\\
  \alpha_t &= \frac{\sum_{i=1}^3<\varepsilon>_+\varepsilon_{\st{nd}}}{\varepsilon_{\st{eq}}^2}
\end{align}
With $\kappa_0$ the damage threshold, $A_t$ and $B_t$ the damage parameter in
traction, $A_c$ and $B_c$ the damage parameter in compression, finally $\beta$
is the shear parameter. The coefficient $A$ and $B$ are the post-pic asymptotic
value and the decay shape parameters.

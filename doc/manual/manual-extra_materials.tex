\subsubsection{Neo-Hookean}
The Neo-Hookean constitutive law is a hyperelastic material formulation, which
results from an extension of the linear elastic relationship (Hooke's Law) for
large deformation. Thus, the model predicts nonlinear stress-strain behavior for
bodies undergoing large deformations.

  \end{center}
\end{figure}

As illustrated in Figure~\ref{fig:smm:cl:neo_hookean}, the behavior is initially
linear but at a certain point it will start to converge to a plateau.  This
constitutive relationship has been proposed by Ronald
Rivlin\cite{ronald-neohooken} and is suitable to simulate rubber-like (\eg
polymers) material behavior. The constitutive equation is
\begin{equation}
  \mat{\sigma } = -p \mat{I} + \mu \mat{B}
\end{equation}
where $p$ is the pressure and $\mat{B}$ is the Finger deformation tensor
($\mat{B}=\mat{F}^{-1}\mat{F}^{-T}$) and $\mat{F}$, as before, the deformation
gradient tensor.  The parameters to indicate in the material file are the same
as those for the elastic case: \code{E} (Young's modulus), \code{nu} (Poisson's
ratio) and \code{Plane\_Stress} (if set to zero plane strain, else plane
stress).

\subsubsection{Visco-elastic (IMPLEMENTATION TO VERIFY!!)}

Visco-elasticity is characterized by time dependent strain behavior. Moreover,
when such a material undergoes a deformation it dissipates some energy. This
dissipation results in a hysteresis loop in the stress-strain curve at every
loading cycle (see Figure~\ref{fig:smm:cl:visco-elastic:hyst}). In principle, it
can be applied to many materials, since all materials exhibit a visco-elastic
behavior if subjected to particular conditions (such as high temperatures).

The standard rheological linear solid model (see Sections 10.2 and 10.3
of~\cite{simo92}) has been implemented in \akantu. This model results from the
combination of a spring mounted in parallel with a spring and a dashpot
connected in series, as illustrated in
Figure~\ref{fig:smm:cl:visco-elastic:model}. The advantage of this model is that
it allows to account for creep and stress relaxation. The equation that relates
the stress to the strain is (in 1D):
\begin{equation}
  \frac{d\epsilon(t)}{dt} = \left ( E + E_V \right ) ^ {-1} \cdot \left [ \frac{d\sigma(t)}{dt} + \frac{E_V}{\eta}\sigma(t) - \frac{EE_V}{\eta}\epsilon(t) \right ]
\end{equation}
where $\eta$ is the viscosity. The equilibrium condition is unique and is
attained in the limit, as $t \to \infty $. At this stage, the response is
elastic and depends on the Young's modulus $E$.  The parameters requested in the
material file are the following: \code{rho} (density), \code{E} (Young's
modulus), \code{nu} (Poisson's ratio), \code{Plane\_Stress} (if set to zero
plane strain, otherwise plane stress), \code{eta} (dashpot viscosity) and
\code{Ev} (stiffness of the viscous element).

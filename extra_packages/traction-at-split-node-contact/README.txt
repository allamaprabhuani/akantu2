Short explanation for AkantuSimTools:

Using ccmake for compilation, give the path to the build folder of akantu. By putting build_shared_libs on, the library is dynamic. Give a cmake_install_prefix (e.g., ./install).

When compiling use: make install (don't forget to create the folder in which you install)
